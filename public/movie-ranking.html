<h1>The Best Movies According to Cristiana</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Before Sunrise</h3>
<p>This movie is the first movie on a triology called Before and it takes place in 1994 in Vienna. <br>
The movie follows a girl and a boy while they explore the city and get to know each other. <br>
Best Romance movie ever made!</p>
<h3>Before Sunset</h3>
<p>This movie is the second movie on a triology called Before and it takes place in 2003 in Paris. <br>
The movie follows a woman and a man while they explore the city and talk about the night they met in Vienna. <br>
The plot stays the same but the vibe is immaculated!</p>
<h3>Before Midnight</h3>
<p>This movie is the third movie on a triology called Before and it takes place in 2011 in Greece. <br>
The movie follows a woman and a man married and with kids, and their marriage problems, even though they're romance started in a epic way and with passion <br />
It's not an happy ever after which makes it realistic!</p>
